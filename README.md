Looking into open data provided by the city of Durham, North Carolina

The city of Durham, among others in North Carolina, provide an open set of [data](https://durhamnc.gov/1487/Open-Government) on a variety of subjects. Some of these subjects get mentioned frequently in online forums, but without a lot of understanding of the hard numbers. It is a goal of this repo to inspect some of the issues of the city from a purely statistical perspective, and to educate others and myself about the city I love and call home.

I also have lots of ideas about using the building permit data for exploring the changing landscape of our city! More to come on that later...

Please be patient as I slowly put these details together, I'm also trying to graduate!

## Currently working on setting up access to DB2 so we can use SQL commands for querying the data
